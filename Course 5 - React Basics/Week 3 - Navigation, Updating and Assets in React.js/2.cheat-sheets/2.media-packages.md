# Media packages

Here, you’ll learn how to install the `reactjs-media` npm package.

You can find this package on the `npmjs.org` website at the following URL: 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player

To install this package you'll need to use the following command _in the terminal_:

```
npm install react-player
```

Once you have this package installed, you can start using it in your project.

There are a few ways that you can import and use the installed package. For example, to get the entire package's functionality, use the following import:

```jsx
import ReactPlayer from "react-player";
```

If you are, for example, only planning to use videos from a site like YouTube, to reduce bundle size, you can use the following import:

```jsx
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";
```

Here’s an example of using the react-player packaged in a small React app:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactPlayer from "react-player/youtube";

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyVideo />
        </div>
    );
};

const MyVideo = () => {
    return (
        <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U' />
    );
};

export default App;
```
