# Knowledge check: State or stateless

1. What is a stateless component?
    - A component that doesn’t track its own state.
    - A component that doesn’t track its parent’s state.
    ```
    Answer: A component that doesn’t track its own state.
    Explanation: A stateless component doesn’t track its own state. 
    ```

2. A stateful component must have a props object.
    - False
    - True
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: Whether or not a stateful component has a props object is irrelevant. 
    ```

3. To turn a stateless component into a stateful component, you must pass it a props object.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: Whether or not a stateful component receives a props object is irrelevant. 
    ```

4. The process of lifting up state can lead to: 
    - A stateful child component controlling the state of a stateful parent component.
    - A stateful component becoming a stateless component.
    - A stateless component becoming a stateful component.
    - A stateful child component controlling the state of a stateless parent component.
    ```
    Answer: A stateful component becoming a stateless component.
            A stateless component becoming a stateful component.
    Explanation: Lifting up state means moving state up from a child to the parent component - meaning that a previously stateless parent component becomes a stateful component, and a previously stateful child component becomes a stateless component. 
    ```

5. A prop doesn't have to always pass state.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
