# Setting up a React project in VS Code

To follow along in this reading, you need to have Node.js and VS Code already installed on your computer.

In VS Code, you're ready to start a brand new React project.

You can do it using `npm`.

## What is npm?

When Node.js is installed on a computer, __npm__ comes bundled with it.

With __npm__, you can:

1. Author your own Node.js modules ("packages"), and publish them on the npm website so that other people can download and use them 

2. Use other people's authored modules ("packages") 

So, ultimately, __npm__ is all about _code sharing and reuse_. You can __use other people's code__ in your own projects, and you can also __publish your own Node.js modules__ so that other people can use them.

An example npm module that can be useful for a new React developer is [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). While this npm module comes with its own website, you can also find some info on the [create-react-app project on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

Whenever you run the `npm` command to add other people's code, __that code, and all other Node modules that depend on it, get downloaded__ to your machine.

However, although it's possible do to so, this is not really necessary, at least in the case of the `create-react-app` Node module.

In other words, you can avoid installing the `create-react-app` package but still use it.

You can do that by running the following command: 

```
npm init react-app {your app name}
```

You can use any app name you’d like, but it’s always good to have a name that is descriptive and short.

## Opening the built-in VS Code terminal and running `npm init react-app` command

In VS Code, click on _View_, _Terminal_ to open the built-in terminal.

Now run the command to add a brand new React app to the machine:

```
npm init react-app firstapp
```

The installation and setup might take a few minutes.

Here's what the output of executing the above command may look like:

```

Run `npm audit` for details.

Created git commit.

Success! Created firstapp at /home/pc/Desktop/firstapp

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    npm start
    Starts the development server.

    npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

    npm test
    Starts the test runner.

    npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

cd firstapp
npm start
```

If you follow the suggestions from the above output, you'll run: 

```
cd firstapp
```

and then 

```
npm start
```

This will end up with the following output in the built-in terminal:

```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view firstapp in the browser.

Local:            http://localhost:3000
On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.167:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully
```

Again, following the instructions, opening a browser with the address bar pointing to http://localhost:3000, will show the following page in your browser:

This means that you've successfully:

- Set up your local development environment 

- Run the create-react-app npm package (without installing it!) 

- Built a starter React app on your local machine 

- Served that starter React app in your browser 

After you've built your starting setup, you can start working with the basic building blocks of React: components.
