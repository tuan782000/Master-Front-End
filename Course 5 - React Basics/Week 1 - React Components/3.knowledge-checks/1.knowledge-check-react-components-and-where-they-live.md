1. When adding a component name after the function keyword, it should be named using:
    - lowerCamelCase
    - kebab-cased
    - PascalCase (UpperCamelCase)
    ```
    Answer: PascalCase (UpperCamelCase)
    Explanation: The first letter should be uppercased, with all the following words starting with an uppercased letter, without spaces.
    ```

2. There are two components at the root of the src folder: `Example` and `App`. To import the `Example` component into the `App` component, you should use the following syntax:
    - ```js
        import Example;`
      ```
    - ```js
        import “Example”;
      ```
    - ```js
        import Example from “./Example”;
      ```
    Answer: import Example from “./Example”;
    Explanation: The syntax has the following structure: import ComponentName from “./ComponentName”
    ```

3. True or False: You can omit the `./` from the import statement, when both the exported and the imported components are in the same folder.

    - False
    ```

      ```

        export default Example;
      ```

      ```
    ```

    Explanation: The correct syntax includes the keywords “export”, followed by “default”, followed by the name of the component. 
    ```
