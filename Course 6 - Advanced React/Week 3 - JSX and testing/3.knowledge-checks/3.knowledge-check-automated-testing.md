# Knowledge check: Automated testing

1. Why is automated testing important? Select all that apply.
    - It saves time to development teams.
    - It reduces human error.
    - It offers a faster feedback cycle, bringing faster validation and helping the development team to detect problems or bugs early.
    ```
    Answer: It saves time to development teams.
            It reduces human error.
            It offers a faster feedback cycle, bringing faster validation and helping the development team to detect problems or bugs early.
    Explanation: Development teams spend less time manually validating newly developed features.
                 Manual testing opens up the opportunity for humans to make mistakes.
                 Without test automation feedback for newly developed features can take a while.

2. What are some of the best practices when writing your automated tests? Select all that apply
    - They should be maintainable in the long run.
    - Your tests need to be focused on the implementation details of your components.
    - They should resemble the way your software is used.
    ```
    Answer: They should be maintainable in the long run.
            They should resemble the way your software is used.
    Explanation: In that way, changes in the implementation of the component, but not functionality, won’t break your tests and slow you and your team down.
                 The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.
    ```

3. Imagine you have a component that renders both an `input` tag and a `label` tag with the exact text `Comments:`. Inside your test, you have the below piece of code:
    ```jsx
    const element = screen.getByLabelText(/Comments:/);
    ```
    What would be the type of element returned by `getByLabelText`?
    - The document object
    - The `label` element
    - The `input` element
    ```
    Answer: The input element
    Explanation: The query looks for the label tag first, but it returns the input associated with it.
    ```

4. In a particular test that’s been written for a form component, you encounter the below two lines of code. What kind of data would the `handleSubmit` variable represent?
    ```jsx
    const handleSubmit = jest.fn();
    render(<FeedbackForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);
    ```
    - A mock function to track how is called by external code and thus explore the arguments passed in.
    - A copy of the real function that’s used in the parent component that renders the `FeedbackForm`.
    - A specific function jest provides to handle form submissions 
    ```
    Answer: A mock function to track how is called by external code and thus explore the arguments passed in.
    Explanation: handleSubmit is a special function called “a mock” that the jest library provides to track how it is called by external code.
    ```

5. What are some of the benefits of Continuous Integration (CI)? Select all that apply.
    - Improved developer productivity.
    - Find bugs earlier and fix them faster.
    - Faster manual integrations.
    - Deliver working software more often.
    ```
    Answer: Improved developer productivity.
            Find bugs earlier and fix them faster.
            Deliver working software more often.
    Explanation: Developers can focus on programming the features the business needs.
                 The CI can run a suit of automated tests and check for failures, so developers are notified promptly.
                 It provides a faster feedback look.
    ```
