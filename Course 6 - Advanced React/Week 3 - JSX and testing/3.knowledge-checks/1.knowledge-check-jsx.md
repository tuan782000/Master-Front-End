# Knowledge check: JSX

1. Let’s suppose you have the below JSX that gets returned from a component, what would be the equivalent object representation (Element) that React will create internally?
    ```jsx
    <button className='button-primary'>
        <div>
            Submit
        </div>
    </button>
    ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: "button",
            props: {
                className: "button-primary",
                children: {
                    type: "div",
                    children: "Submit"
                },
            },
        }
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: "button",
            props: {
                className: "button-primary",
                children: {
                    type: "div",
                    props: {
                        children: "Submit",
                    } 
                },
            },
        }
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: Button,
            props: {
                className: "button-primary",
                children: "div",
            },
        }
        ```
    ```
    Answer: {
                type: "button",
                props: {
                    className: "button-primary",
                    children: {
                        type: "div",
                        props: {
                            children: "Submit",
                        } 
                    },
                },
            }
    Explanation: The children key also should point to an element, so it has to have two keys: type and props.
    ```

2. What is the concept of component specialization?
    - A component that is designed to fulfill one specific purpose and nothing else. 
    - A component defined as a special case of another more generic component. 
    - A component that doesn’t know its children ahead of time and acts as a generic box. 
    ```
    Answer: A component defined as a special case of another more generic component. 
    Explanation: For example, a SubmitButton component is a more specialized version of a Button component.
    ```

3. You would like to clone a React element by using the `React.cloneElement` API, where the particular element has the below structure:
    ```jsx
    const buttonElement = {
        type: SubmitButton,
        props: {
            color: "green",
            children: "Submit!",
        },
    };
    ```
    What would be the value of the variable output when using the API with the following parameters?
    ```jsx
    const output = React.cloneElement(buttonElement, {disabled: true, color: “blue” });
    ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: SubmitButton,
            props: {
                color: "blue",
                children: "Submit!",
                disabled: true,
            },
        };
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: SubmitButton,
            props: {
                disabled: true,
                color: "blue",
            },
        };
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {
            type: SubmitButton,
            props: {
                color: "green",
                children: "Submit!",
                disabled: true,
            },
        };
        ```
    ```
    Answer: {
                type: SubmitButton,
                props: {
                    color: "blue",
                    children: "Submit!",
                    disabled: true,
                },
            };
    Explanation: The color props gets overridden and a new prop called disabled with a value of true gets added.
    ```

4. Imagine you are using the spread operator in the below component as follows:
    ```jsx
    const props = { title: "tiramisu", cal: 400 };
    const element = <Component title="cake" {...props} cal={500} />;
    ```
    What would be the value of element.props?
    -   ```jsx
        { title: "cake", cal: 400 }
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        { title: "tiramisu", cal: 400 } 
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        { title: "tiramisu", cal: 500 }
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        { title: "cake", cal: 500 } 
        ```
    ```
    Answer: { title: "tiramisu", cal: 500 }
    Explanation: that’s the final value.
    ```

5. Amongst the below expressions, select all that will not render anything on the screen when being used in JSX.
    -   ```jsx
        <div>{false}</div> 
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        <div>{(() => true)()}</div>
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        <div>{null}</div>
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        <div>{undefined}</div> 
        ```
    ```
    Answer: <div>{(() => true)()}</div>
            <div>{(() => true)()}</div>
            <div>{null}</div>
            <div>{undefined}</div> 
    Explanation: The false value will not render anything
                 The function gets invoked instantly in place and returns a value of true, which will not render anything
                 The null value will not render anything
                 The undefined value will not render anything
    ```
