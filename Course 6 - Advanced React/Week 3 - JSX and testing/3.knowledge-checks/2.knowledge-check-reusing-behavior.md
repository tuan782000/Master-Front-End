# Knowledge check: Reusing behavior

1. When dealing with cross-cutting data in your React applications, what are some of the problems of using a custom hook to encapsulate that logic? Select all that apply.
    - That it turns a stateless component into a stateful one.
    - There are no problems at all with hooks, being the best suited tool for the job.
    - The fact that you would have to alter the implementation of each component that needs that specific data. 
    ```
    Answer: That it turns a stateless component into a stateful one.
            The fact that you would have to alter the implementation of each component that needs that specific data. 
    Explanation: The addition of a custom hook that deals with specific data introduces state into the component.
                 You would have to add the custom hook to each particular component that needs that data.
    ```

2. Here, you can find the APIs of some higher-order components that have been already implemented. Amongst all the options, which ones present an invalid signature that doesn’t follow the convention? Select all that apply.
    -   ```jsx
        withSubscription(() => getData())(Component)
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        withSubscription(() => getData(), Component) 
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        withSubscription(Component, options)
        ```
    ```
    Answer: withSubscription(() => getData(), Component) 
    Explanation: The component should come as the first argument and any additional parameters should go afterwards.
    ```

3. What are some of the best practices to follow when implementing the higher-order component pattern? Select all that apply.
    - Maximize composability. 
    - Mutate the original component 
    - Always use HOCs and create your enhanced components inside other components.
    - Passed unrelated props through to the Wrapped Component.
    ```
    Answer: Maximize composability. 
            Passed unrelated props through to the Wrapped Component.
    Explanation: Using proper API definitions allow you to combine different HOCs in a composable manner.
                 You should pass all the other props through to the wrapped component.
    ```

4. What are some of the differences between higher-order components and `render` props? Select all that apply.
    - They inject the new props in the component to be enhanced in a different way.
    - Higher-order components modify the original implementation of the component, whereas the Render Props pattern doesn’t. 
    - Render props provide the new data as a function parameter, whereas components wrapped with an HOC get the new data as a new prop. 
    ```
    Answer: They inject the new props in the component to be enhanced in a different way.
            Render props provide the new data as a function parameter, whereas components wrapped with an HOC get the new data as a new prop. 
    Explanation: render props dynamically inside the JSX and HOCs as an extra prop.
                 render props do so dynamically inside the JSX and HOCs provide an extra prop.
    ```

5. True or false. A component with a `render` prop as renderer can do anything a higher-order component can do.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: They are just two different implementations for encapsulating cross-cutting concerns, but they serve the same purpose.
    ```
