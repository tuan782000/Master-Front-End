# Working with complex data in useState

## The correct way to update the state object in React when using useState

The suggested approach for updating the state object in React when using `useState` is to copy the state object and then update the copy.

This usually involves using the spread operator (`...`).

Keeping this in mind, here's the updated code:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"; 
 
export default function App() { 
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState({ greet: "Hello, World" }); 
  console.log(greeting, setGreeting); 
 
  function updateGreeting() { 
    const newGreeting = {...greeting}; 
    newGreeting.greet = "Hello, World-Wide Web"; 
    setGreeting(newGreeting); 
  } 
 
  return ( 
    <div> 
      <h1>{greeting.greet}</h1> 
      <button onClick={updateGreeting}>Update greeting</button> 
    </div> 
  ); 
}
```

To reiterate, the proper way of working with state when it's saved as an object is to:

1. Copy the old state object using the spread (`...`) operator and save it into a new variable and 
2. Pass the new variable to the state-updating function 

## Updating the state object using arrow functions

Now, letâ€™s use a more complex object to update state.

The state object now has two properties: `greet` and `location`.

The intention of this update is to demonstrate what to do when only a specific property of the state object is changing, while keeping the remaining properties unchanged:

```jsx
import { useState } from "react"; 
 
export default function App() { 
  const [greeting, setGreeting] = useState( 
    { 
        greet: "Hello", 
        place: "World" 
    } 
  ); 
  console.log(greeting, setGreeting); 
 
  function updateGreeting() { 
    setGreeting(prevState => { 
        return {...prevState, place: "World-Wide Web"} 
    }); 
  } 
 
  return ( 
    <div> 
      <h1>{greeting.greet}, {greeting.place}</h1> 
      <button onClick={updateGreeting}>Update greeting</button> 
    </div> 
  ); 
} 
```

The reason this works is because it uses the previous state, which is named `prevState`, and this is the previous value of the greeting variable. In other words, it makes a copy of the `prevState` object, and updates only the place property on the copied object. It then returns a brand-new object: 

```jsx
return {...prevState, place: "World-Wide Web"} 
```

Everything is wrapped in curly braces so that this new object is built correctly, and it is returned from the call to `setGreeting`.
