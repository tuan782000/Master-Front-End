# Knowledge check: Getting started with hooks

1. Imagine you have to log into the console a state variable, whenever the variable gets updated. What's the best place to perform such operation in a React component?
    - Before the return statement of the component
    - the useEffect hook 
    ```
    Answer: the useEffect hook
    Explanation: All side effects should be inside the useEffect hook.
    ```

2. The `useEffect` hook accepts...
    - a callback function and an object 
    - a callback function and an array 
    - two callback functions 
    ```
    Answer: a callback function and an array 
    Explanation: The useEffect hook accepts a callback function and an array.
    ```

3. What is a pure React component?
    - A component that doesn't have any side effects
    - A component that has at least one side effect
    ```
    Answer: A component that doesn't have any side effects
    Explanation: A pure component doesn't present any side effects
    ```

4. What is the name of the second argument of the `useEffect()` call?
    - the dependency array 
    - the callback function 
    - the destructured object 
    - the dependencies object 
    ```
    Answer: the dependency array
    Explanation: The name of the second argument is the dependency array.
    ```

5. This code is incomplete:
    ```jsx
    React.useEffect(()=> {
        console.log('The value of the toggle variable is',toggle)
    }, [])
    ```
    You need to update the dependecies array so that the `useEffect` hook is invoked whenever the toggle variable updates. Choose the correct solution from the choices below.
    - The dependencies array should receive the toggle variable as its single member. 
    - The dependencies array should be removed. 
    - The dependencies array should be updated to: `[{toggle}]`. 
    - The dependencies array should be replaced with: `{toggle}`. 
    ```
    Answer: The dependencies array should receive the toggle variable as its single member.
    Explanation: The dependencies array should receive the toggle variable as its single member: [toggle].
    ```
