# Additional resources

## Getting started with hooks

- The article on [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) assignment describes how the destructuring assignment, which allows you to get values out of the array that gets returned when the `useState` hook is invoked, works in more detail. 

- [The read props inside the child component](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) link on the Beta version of React docs discusses how to use destructuring assignment to get values out of the props object. 

- The [useState reference on official React docs website](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useState#usestate) helps you understand how to work with this hook and some of the caveats involved. 

- The [useEffect reference on official React docs website](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useEffect#useeffect) helps you understand the syntax of this hook and goes into some depth to explain how to use and troubleshoot the `useEffect` hook. 

## Rules of Hooks and Fetching Data with Hooks

- The [Rules of Hooks reading on Reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) website gives you an overview of how to work with the hooks as recommended by the React Core team at Meta. 

- The [Fetching data with Effects](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useEffect#fetching-data-with-effects) article on React docs discusses fetching data using a few different approaches, including using async / await syntax. 

- [How to use promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) is a resource that describes the "behind-the-scenes" of how data fetching works in greater depth. 

- [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) is a resource on MDN that discusses the use of the async and await keywords as a more recent way to handle API requests in JavaScript. 

## Advanced hooks

- The [useReducer hook reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) on Reactjs.orgâ€™s website discusses the basics of `useReducer`, along with specifying initial state and lazy initialization. 

- The Beta version of Reactjs.org's docs has a reference on [the syntax and usage of the useReducer hook](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useReducer#usereducer) which complements the previous link. 

- The Beta version of Reactjs.org's docs also has a reference on [using the useRef hook](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useRef#useref) which is a great example of various options that are available when working with the `useRef` hook. 

- The [Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) reference on Reactjs.org's Beta version discusses the dynamics of custom hooks and provides a few practical examples to complement the theory behind them.
