# Module quiz: Components

1. When using a key for your list items, what’s the best general choice?
    - Using an ID generated by a library that guarantees no duplications. 
    - Using an ID coming from the data, that points to the database ID. 
    - Using an index. 
    ```
    Answer: Using an ID coming from the data, that points to the database ID. 
    Explanation: that’s the preferred option.
    ```

2. Imagine you have a specification for rendering the following list item: `<li>Ice cream - 200 cal</li>`, where the name and the number of calories are coming as dynamic data. Select all the options that would correctly render the desired output:
    -   ```jsx
        <li>{Ice cream - 200 {item.cal}}</li>
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        <li>{item.name} - {item.cal} cal</li>
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        <li>{`${item.name} - ${item.cal} cal`}</li>
        ```
    ```
    Answer: <li>{item.name} - {item.cal} cal</li>
            <li>{`${item.name} - ${item.cal} cal`}</li>
    Explanation: <li>{item.name} - {item.cal} cal</li> would render the desired output using JSX syntax.
                 <li>{`${item.name} - ${item.cal} cal`}</li> would render the desired output using JSX syntax and string interpolation.
    ```

3. Let’s suppose you have a list of two items and a new item is added to the list. From the point of view of the React diffing algorithm, what’s the most optimal position for the new element added? Select all that apply
    - The new element added at the beginning. 
    - The new element added in the 2nd position, in between the existing list items. 
    - The new element added at the end. 
    ```
    Answer: The new element added at the end. 
    Explanation: that’s the most optimal path.
    ```

4. What are controlled components?
    - A set of components whose internal state is controlled by the DOM. 
    - A set of components whose internal state is controlled by React. 
    - A set of components whose value is determined by React refs. 
    ```
    Answer: A set of components whose internal state is controlled by React. 
    Explanation: State is delegated from the DOM to React local state.
    ```

5. What are the features you can still achieve with uncontrolled components? Select all that apply
    - One time value retrieval on submit using a React `ref`.
    - Validation on submit. 
    - Conditionally disabling the submit button. 
    ```
    Answer: One time value retrieval on submit using a React ref. 
            Validation on submit. 
    Explanation: The ref allows you to access the internal state held by the DOM.
                 In the submit handler function you can use refs to access all the input values and perform any custom client validation.
    ```

6. When creating an API for context consumers via `useContext`, what’s the argument you have to provide to the `useContext` call?
    - The `Context.Provider` component. 
    - The Context object obtained via the `createContext` call. 
    - The React state that defines the global state to be injected. 
    ```
    Answer: The Context object obtained via the createContext call. 
    Explanation: You always have to pass a context object as argument to the useContext hook.
    ```

7. Imagine the below component structure, where all components `ComponentA`, `ComponentB` and `ComponentC` are simple presentational components that hold no props or state:
    ```jsx
    const App = () => {
        return(
            <AppContext.Provider>
                <ComponentA />
            </AppContext.Provider>
        );
    };
    
    const ComponentA = React.memo(() => <ComponentB />);
    const ComponentB = () => <ComponentC />;
    const ComponentC = () => null;
    ```
    If the App component re-rendered for whatever reason, what would be the sequence of component re-renders that would take place?
    - `App` -> `ComponentA` -> `ComponentB` -> `ComponentC`. 
    - `App` -> `ComponentB` -> `ComponentC` 
    - `App` 
    ```
    Answer: App
    Explanation: Since ComponentA is wrapped with React.memo, it will prevent unnecessary updates within itself and down the tree, so only the App component would update.
    ```

8. Even though props and state are inherently different, what are areas where they overlap? Select all that apply.
    - Both props and state are plain JS objects. 
    - Both props and state changes trigger a render update. 
    - Both props and state are deterministic, meaning that your component always generates the same output for the same combination of props and state. 
    ```
    Answer: Both props and state are plain JS objects. 
            Both props and state changes trigger a render update. 
            Both props and state are deterministic, meaning that your component always generates the same output for the same combination of props and state. 
    Explanation: They are both plain JS objects.
                 As soon as one or the other update, it will trigger a re-render.
                 React components are pure functions when it comes to their rendering output.
    ```

9. When defining a JavaScript object as a piece of local React state that will be injected as context, what is the specific React hook that allows you to keep the same object reference in memory and prevent unnecessary re-renders if the object itself hasn’t changed any values?
    - `useCallback`
    - `useMemo`
    - `useRef`
    ```
    Answer: useMemo
    Explanation: useMemo keeps in memory the previous object reference and if no changes occur in the object values, it will reuse the same reference on subsequent updates.
    ```

10. What are some possible examples of application features that are well suited to be defined as React context? Select all that apply
    - The application theme.
    - Locale preferences. 
    - The current authenticated user.
    - The value of a text input.
    ```
    Answer: The application theme.
            Locale preferences. 
            The current authenticated user.
    Explanation: The theme is one example of global application state.
                 Local preferences is one example of global application state.
                 Authenticated user is one example of global application state.
    ```
