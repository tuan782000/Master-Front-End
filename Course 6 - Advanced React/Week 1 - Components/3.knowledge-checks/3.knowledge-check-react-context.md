# Knowledge check: React Context

1. What of the below scenarios are valid for choosing context instead of local state? Select all that apply.
    - The visibility state of an alert that overlays into the whole application.
    - The locale or language that should be used in the application’s text. 
    - The current selection of a group of radio buttons.
    ```
    Answer: The visibility state of an alert that overlays into the whole application.
            The locale or language that should be used in the application’s text. 
    Explanation: Global alerts are well suited for context since any component can trigger them.
                 Global state that affects all component’s text.
    ```

2. What is the problem of props drilling? Select all that apply.
    - Components not knowing the local state of their parents.
    - Components receiving more props than they should.
    - Components having to pass down props all the way to the children that need to consume them.
    ```
    Answer: Components receiving more props than they should.
            Components having to pass down props all the way to the children that need to consume them.
    Explanation: Props drilling involves components receiving props that they don’t use or need at all.
                 Components drill down props across several levels to reach the children that need them.
    ```

3. When creating a new piece of application state, what is the bare minimum of React APIs you would need to define it?
    - Context and local state.
    - Context and props.
    - Context, props and local state.
    ```
    Answer: Context and local state.
    Explanation: you need local state to define the global state and Context to inject it into a tree.
    ```

4. What happens when the `value` prop of the Context Provider changes?
    - All the consumer components re-render with the updated value.
    - The Context Provider component gets recreated.
    - The whole component tree under the Context Provider gets re-rendered.
    ```
    Answer: All the consumer components re-render with the updated value.
    Explanation: All components subscribed to that context get updated.
    ```

5. What happens when you wrap a component with the `React.memo` API, such as `React.memo(Component)`. Select all that apply.
    - Whether the component should re-render could be determined by some custom logic that uses the previous props and the current props.
    - React provides a performance optimization.
    - The component never gets updated no matter if there was a change in its local state or the props it receives.
    ```
    Answer: Whether the component should re-render could be determined by some custom logic that uses the previous props and the current props.
            React provides a performance optimization.
    Explanation: You can provide an additional function that receives previous props and current props to determine if an update should occur.
                 React avoids unnecessary re-renders automatically.
