# Knowledge check: Rendering Lists in React

1. Imagine you have an array with one object that represents a dessert. You would like to apply some transformation to the item to output a different structure using the `map` function as per the code below. What would be the value of the `newDesserts` variable?
    ```jsx
    const desserts = [
        {
            title: 'Chocolate Cake',
            description: 'Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate',
            calories: 500,
        }
    ];

    const newDesserts = desserts.map((dessert) => {
        return {
            title: dessert.title.toUpperCase(),
            ...dessert,
            kCal: dessert.calories / 1000,
        };
    });
    ```
    -   ```jsx
        [
            {
                title: 'CHOCOLATE CAKE',
                description: 'Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate',
                kCal: 0.5,
            }
        ] 
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        [
            {
                title: 'Chocolate Cake',
                description: 'Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate',
                calories: 500,
                kCal: 0.5,
            }
        ]
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        [
            {
                title: 'CHOCOLATE CAKE',
                description: 'Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate',
                calories: 500,
                kCal: 0.5,
            }
        ]
        ```
    ```
    Answer: [
                {
                    title: 'Chocolate Cake',
                    description: 'Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate',
                    calories: 500,
                    kCal: 0.5,
                }
            ]
    Explanation: Since the mapping output merges the previous object values after the title is re-defined, it has no effect and the title is still as before. Also, a new property is introduced, kCal.
    ```

2. How do you access dynamic data inside the JSX from the `render` function?
    - Using local state in the component. 
    - Using component props. 
    - Wrapping the variable in question with curly braces. 
    ```
    Answer: Wrapping the variable in question with curly braces. 
    Explanation: That’s the way to access dynamic data in JSX.
    ```

3. What could be a potential problem of using a randomiser function that generates an integer number from 0 to 10 as a key for your list items, having a list of only eight items? Select all that apply
    - The randomiser function does not entirely guarantee that the keys it generates will be different per item and a collision could happen, having two items with the same integer as keys.
    - There is no persistence of the keys generated since the moment the component re-renders the keys will vary and that could cause unexpected UI changes. 
    - The randomiser function is a potential performance bottleneck since it has to run every re-render and it’s an unnecessary computation. 
    ```
    Answer: The randomiser function does not entirely guarantee that the keys it generates will be different per item and a collision could happen, having two items with the same integer as keys.
            There is no persistence of the keys generated since the moment the component re-renders the keys will vary and that could cause unexpected UI changes. 
    Explanation: Since each value generated from the randomiser function is independent of the other, you could have key duplications.
                 When a re-render occurs, the randomiser could generate a different value per list item and that could cause issues with the internal state of the component.
    ```

4. The `todos` array contains a list of `todo` objects, where each object has an `id` property that is unique. Which of the following code snippets will throw a React warning when opening up the browser console? Select all that apply
    -   ```jsx
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <ToDo id={todo.id} />
        ))}
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <ToDo id={todo.id} />
        ))}
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <ToDo key={todo.id} id={todo.id} />
        ))}
        ```
    -   ```jsx
        {todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <ToDo key=”myKey” id={todo.id} />
        ))}
        ```
    ```
    Answer: {todos.map((todo, index) => (
                <ToDo id={todo.id} />
            ))}

            {todos.map((todo, index) => (
                <ToDo key=”myKey” id={todo.id} />
            ))}
    Explanation: Since a key per list item is missing, React will throw a warning in the console.
                 The keys are all the same for all items and React will throw a warning in the console regarding that problem.
    ```

5. What are the potential problems of using indexes as keys?
    - An index is not guaranteed to be unique. 
    - If the order of items may change, that can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. 
    - The index is not persisted and will change the moment the component re-renders. 
    ```
    Answer: If the order of items may change, that can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. 
    Explanation: Indexes are discouraged when the order of the items may change.
